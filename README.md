## Note

This package is forked from the wonderful [fast_rss Elixir package](https://github.com/avencera/fast_rss) from [Avencera](https://github.com/avencera). All I changed was the underlying Rust code so that the package can be used to parse an Atom feed. All credit should go to that package's authors.
